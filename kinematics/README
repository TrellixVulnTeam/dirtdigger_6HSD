A crazy idea but ..
we have a 3 joint robot arm.

 we want to find what angles to set each joint for a requested X/Y location.

This will have more than one solution making conventonal maths awkward.


What we can do is rotate the base arm to each of 180 degrees and calculate the X, Y loc ation of the end of the arm.
For each degree rotate the second arm 180 degrees , keeping in mind the angle set up be the base arm. this will give us an XY location for that arm.
Repeat the same for the third arm.
Add the Xoffsets and the Yoffsets for each arm to get the XY location for that combination of angles.

NOte that we can simplyfy this still more by building up an index of angles and offsets for each arm, we'll do that next.

The result will give us a very large array of outputs
(5832000 locations)

We do some work to make this bounded for smaller systems and make searches easier.

The thing is connected to a web socket so we can ask for a XY and get suggested angles or ask for angles and get the XY location.

With 3 arms we can get many solutions for a given XY location. move the XY point just a bit and we want the next solution that uses a minimun of arm movement.
So given one solution we then run through the list of "next" solutions that uses teh smallest arm movement.


Cool
