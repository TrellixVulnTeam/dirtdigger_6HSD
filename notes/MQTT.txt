MQTT a free fast message broker

https://tutorials-raspberrypi.com/raspberry-pi-mqtt-broker-client-wireless-communication/

There are several applications that can be used to send and receive through MQTT, but the simplest on the Raspberry Pi is probably Mosquitto. 

We will install this on the Raspberry Pi first:

sudo apt-get install -y mosquitto mosquitto-clients

mosquitto_sub -h localhost -v -t test/motor
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t test/motor -m "Hello Raspberry Pi Motor"

(mosquitto_sub -h localhost -v -t "\$SYS/#")

For python

sudo pip install paho-mqtt
or
git clone https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.python.git
cd paho.mqtt.python
python setup.py install

Test this with 
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t MOTOR_chan -m '{"cmd":"run","speed":0.5,"heading":370, "steer":-0.3}'
get status with mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t MOTOR_stat -m 
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -v -t "MOTOR_data"
